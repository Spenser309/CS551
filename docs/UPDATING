20100827:
	From now on, the rc scripts, recovery scripts and system.conf in /etc
	and /usr/etc are updated automatically by make world. If you want to
	change them, do so in the source tree. If you make changes to your
	settings in /etc and /usr/etc, merge them into the the source tree
	before issuing a make world.

20100805:
	mkfs and fsck have been renamed to mkfs.mfs and fsck.mfs, respectively.
	Moreover, they have been moved to /sbin, which is by default not in
	PATH. Edit your .ashrc (or equivalent) to also include /sbin in PATH.
	Also, first issue a 'make commands' before building world.

20100802:
	/usr/src/etc/system.conf updated to include ext2 file server: copy it
	(or merge it) to /etc/system.conf.

20100719:
	If you installed using a 3.1.6 image (or earlier) and haven't updated 
	the boot monitor since r6246 you need to do so now:
	cd /usr/src/boot; make install; sh updateboot.sh

20100714:
	mknod /dev/uds c 18 0
	chmod 666 /dev/uds

20100713:
        /usr/src/etc/rc updated: copy it (or merge it) to /etc/rc.
        /usr/src/etc/system.conf updated to include boot sys services: copy
        it (or merge it) to /etc/system.conf.
        *** WARNING ***: this change breaks binary compatibility with
        old images. Use only newly compiled images (make clean world
        the first time) or download and install the latest ISO.
20100705:
        /usr/src/etc/usr/rc updated: copy it (or merge it) to /usr/etc/rc.
        /usr/src/etc/rc updated: copy it (or merge it) to /etc/rc.
        Perform some cleanup (optional):
        # rm -f /sbin/tty /sbin/log
20100630:
	protocol change between service and rs: be sure to compile commands
	together with the system image and don't use the new userspace with
	an old image (or vice versa); it is recommended to replace
	/boot/image_big with the newly compiled image to keep option 1 in the
	boot menu working.
20100625:
	/etc/mk has been moved to /usr/share/mk. You will need to
	create /usr/share/mk manually.
	# cp -r /usr/src/share/mk /usr/share/
	# cd /usr/src; make -m /usr/share/mk world
20100515:
        /usr/src/etc/usr/rc updated: copy it (or merge it) to /usr/etc/rc.
	/etc/inet.conf is now line-based; if you have hand-edited this file
	before, then make sure that you do not have configurations in there
	that span multiple lines.

	# mkdir /usr/man/man9

	OSS requires an improved make to be compiled; run "make install"
	in /usr/src/commands/make before running "make world".
20070212 (r2751):
	mkfs needs more memory to make an image; chmem it or do
	# touch mkfs.c ; make /usr/bin/mkfs
	in /usr/src/commands/simple.
20070118:
	drivers.conf has been updated to include an ACL for mfs. it has
	to be installed before rebooting after an update of the mount command.
20061222:
	The archictecture-dependent/-independent split needs ARCH=<arch>
	in /etc/make.conf, included by some Makefiles and sourced by
	some shell scripts. To install it, type 'make install' in
	src/etc, or simply copy the file over.
20061222:
	Install binaries in the right order because the new readdir
	implementation and the new mount program are incompatible
	with older kernels and the new kernels require the new mount.
	# cd /usr/src
	# make includes
	# make libraries
	# make cmds
	# make depend
	# cd /usr/src/tools
	# make hdboot
	# make install
	# cd ..
	# make install
	Installing fails for boot. Reboot the system
	# reboot -x 'unset image; boot'
	Now install everything
	# cd /usr/src
	# make install
20060818:
	You need flex in your $PATH, which has become part of the base
	system. This needs bigger binaries.
	If you don't have flex yet, you can compile it first by doing:
	# cp /usr/src/etc/binary_sizes* /etc
	# binsizes big
	# cd /usr/src/commands/flex-2.5.4
	# sh build
