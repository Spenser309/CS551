-- bssh : basic simple shell --

This is the source code for the basic simple shell (bssh).  The bssh was written
to meet the requirements of project one for the CS551 class.

To compile:
   gmake clean all
   
To execute:
   ./bssh

To run tests:
   gmake test
   
To test check the performance of process vs threads:
   start bssh
   ./bssh
   at the BSSH prompt perform the following
   to test threads:
   # time tst/pvst threads
   to test process:
   # time tst/pvst process
   
The bssh has a few limitations compared to other shells.  
1. Does not allow redirection of stderr.
2. Does not allow subshells (IE: $(command))
3. Does not allow the use of shell commands and executable commands to be intermixed on a single line.
